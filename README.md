# ft_printf

## Description
The `ft_printf` project is a programming exercise at 42 school where students are tasked with recoding their own version of the standard C `printf()` function. The goal is to create a library that can reproduce the behavior of the original `printf()` function.

## Objectives
The main objectives of the ft_printf project are:
- Implement a `ft_printf()` function that can handle the same conversion specifiers as the real `printf()`, such as `%d`, `%s`, `%c`, etc.
- Handle additional features like flags, field widths, precision, and length modifiers.
- Implement the function from scratch, without using the original `printf()` function or any related functions from the standard library.

## Requirements
- The `ft_printf()` function must comply with the man 3 `printf`.
- The project will be evaluated on the following criteria:
  - Norminette (42's coding style)
  - Handling of the conversion specifiers
  - Handling of flags, field widths, precision, and length modifiers
  - Memory management
  - Robustness to error cases
